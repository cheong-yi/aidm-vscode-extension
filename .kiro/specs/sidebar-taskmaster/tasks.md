## Enhanced Development Guidelines

### Enhanced Atomic Task Principles

- Each task should take 15-30 minutes maximum
- Implement one method, class, or focused functionality per task with enhanced data
- Write focused unit tests for each task including enhanced data structures
- Clear dependencies between tasks marked explicitly
- No task should implement multiple disparate features
- Always include enhanced data fields in implementations

### Enhanced TDD Workflow Per Task

1. Write failing test(s) for the specific functionality with enhanced data
2. Implement minimum code to make tests pass including enhanced fields
3. Refactor and clean up code ensuring enhanced data integrity
4. Verify integration with previous tasks and enhanced data flow
5. Move to next task only when current is complete with enhanced validation

### Enhanced Integration Strategy

- Test enhanced integration points as separate tasks
- Build enhanced functionality incrementally
- Maintain working state after each enhanced task
- No orphaned or hanging code at any stage
- Always validate enhanced data structures

### Enhanced VSCode Extension Considerations

- Always test enhanced extension activation/deactivation
- Implement proper enhanced resource disposal
- Handle enhanced VSCode context switching gracefully
- Consider enhanced extension startup time impact
- Test with multiple enhanced workspace scenarios

### Enhanced Cursor Integration Considerations

- Always implement enhanced fallback mechanisms (clipboard copy)
- Test with both enhanced Cursor available and unavailable scenarios
- Validate enhanced extracted context before prompt generation
- Handle different enhanced Cursor installation patterns
- Provide clear enhanced user feedback for AI operations

## Key Refinements for Cursor AI Implementation

### Prompt Engineering Guidelines

**For Each Atomic Task:**

1. **Specific Acceptance Criteria**: Include exact UI mockup references where applicable
2. **Data Structure Examples**: Provide concrete examples of expected input/output data
3. **Error Scenarios**: Define specific error cases and expected handling
4. **Testing Requirements**: Specify exact test cases to write
5. **Integration Points**: Clearly define how the task connects to existing code

**Enhanced Task Prompt Template:**

```
# Task Implementation: [Task Title]

[Specific context with mockup references]

## Task Description
- **ID**: [Task ID]
- **Title**: [Task Title]
- **Complexity**: [Low/Medium/High]
- **Dependencies**: [Completed task IDs]
- **Duration**: 15-20 minutes

## Mockup Reference
Reference the HTML mockup sections: [specific div classes or UI elements]

## Data Structure Requirements
[Exact TypeScript interfaces and example data]

## Implementation Details
[Specific methods, classes, or functionality to implement]

## Acceptance Criteria
[Numbered list of testable requirements]

```

### Critical Success Factors

1. **Mockup Alignment**: Every UI task must reference specific mockup elements
2. **Data Contract Compliance**: All data structures must match the enhanced Task interface
3. **Time Formatting Consistency**: All timestamps must use the TimeFormattingUtility
4. **Executable Task Logic**: Clear rules for when tasks show the 🤖 icon and blue border
5. **Test Result Integration**: Proper handling of FailingTest objects with error categorization
6. **Status Action Mapping**: Correct implementation of STATUS_ACTIONS for different task states

These enhanced specifications provide a comprehensive foundation for implementing the expandable list Taskmaster Dashboard that precisely matches your mockup design.
