# Requirements Document - Sidebar Taskmaster Dashboard

## Introduction

The Sidebar Taskmaster Dashboard is a new UI module within the enterprise-ai-context-extension that provides developers with an intelligent task management interface. This module shifts developer focus from manual implementation to intelligent review and management of tasks, leveraging AI assistants (RooCode/Gemini) and institutional knowledge from MCP Servers. The dashboard will be displayed as an expandable list design in the VSCode sidebar, featuring collapsible task items with detailed information panels.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see a high-level overview of all assigned tasks in an expandable list view, so that I can quickly understand my workload and task priorities while accessing detailed information when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is activated THEN the system SHALL display a task list view in the VSCode sidebar
2. WHEN the task list view is displayed THEN the system SHALL show task ID, task name/title, and status indicator for each task in collapsed state
3. WHEN a task header is clicked THEN the system SHALL expand/collapse the task to show/hide detailed information
4. IF a task has dependencies THEN the system SHALL display dependency relationships in the expanded details section
5. WHEN the task list is refreshed THEN the system SHALL update the list view with current task data from the MCP server
6. WHEN a task is expanded THEN only one task SHALL be expanded at a time (accordion behavior)
7. IF the list contains many tasks THEN the system SHALL support virtual scrolling to maintain performance
8. WHEN a task has status "not_started" THEN the system SHALL display a blue left border and ðŸ¤– icon indicating it's executable with Cursor

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to view detailed information about a task in an expanded view, so that I can understand the full context, requirements, and current status before implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task is expanded THEN the system SHALL display full task description, complexity rating, estimated duration, and dependencies list
2. WHEN task details are displayed THEN the system SHALL show metadata in a grid layout (complexity, estimated duration, dependencies)
3. IF a task has no dependencies THEN the system SHALL display "None" in the dependencies section
4. WHEN task details are loaded THEN the system SHALL maintain expansion state until another task is clicked
5. WHEN no task is expanded THEN all tasks SHALL be in collapsed state showing only header information
6. IF a task has associated test data THEN the system SHALL display test results summary with pass/fail counts
7. WHEN test results include failures THEN the system SHALL provide a collapsible section showing failing test details
8. IF test results have a last run date THEN the system SHALL display relative time format ("2 hours ago")

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to update task status and see status-specific actions, so that I can track progress and take appropriate actions based on the current task state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task status is changed in the expanded view THEN the system SHALL send a JSON-RPC call to the local MCP server using method "tasks/update-status"
2. WHEN the status update API call is made THEN the system SHALL include parameters: taskId (string) and newStatus (TaskStatus enum)
3. IF the status update is successful THEN the system SHALL persist the change to the tasks.md file
4. WHEN the status is updated THEN the system SHALL reflect the change in the task header status badge
5. IF the status update fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
6. IF an invalid status transition is attempted THEN the system SHALL validate and prevent the change before sending to server
7. WHEN a task is expanded THEN the system SHALL display status-specific action buttons based on current task status
8. WHEN task status is "not_started" THEN action buttons SHALL include "ðŸ¤– Execute with Cursor", "Generate Prompt", "View Requirements"
9. WHEN task status is "completed" THEN action buttons SHALL include "View Code", "View Tests", "History"

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the dashboard to automatically refresh task data and show relative timestamps, so that I always have current information with human-readable time formats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is activated THEN the system SHALL automatically fetch task data from the local MCP server
2. WHEN a refresh is triggered THEN the system SHALL retrieve updated task information and maintain current expansion state
3. IF new tasks are added THEN the system SHALL display them in the list view
4. IF task statuses change externally THEN the system SHALL reflect those changes in the UI
5. WHEN auto-refresh is enabled THEN the system SHALL refresh task data every 5 minutes by default
6. WHEN a manual refresh is requested THEN the system SHALL perform a full data fetch from the MCP server
7. IF the refresh operation fails THEN the system SHALL display cached data with a staleness indicator
8. WHEN displaying timestamps THEN the system SHALL use relative time format ("2 hours ago", "45 minutes ago")
9. IF timestamp formatting fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to absolute time display

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the dashboard to handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful test failure information, so that I can continue working and quickly identify issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP server is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
2. IF API calls fail THEN the system SHALL provide retry options
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log them according to existing error handling patterns
4. IF the tasks.md file cannot be read THEN the system SHALL display a fallback message
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display a visual error indicator (red icon) in the status bar
6. IF the error state persists THEN the system SHALL provide a "Report Issue" button with error details
7. WHEN in error state THEN the system SHALL disable interactive features that require server communication
8. WHEN test failures are displayed THEN the system SHALL categorize errors by type (assertion, type, filesystem, timeout, network)
9. IF test failure details are available THEN the system SHALL show test name, error message, and error category in a collapsible section

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the dashboard to integrate with existing extension infrastructure and provide enhanced task data, so that it follows established patterns and provides rich task information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

9. WHEN test results have timestamps THEN the system SHALL display relative time since last test run

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to click on executable tasks to automatically generate contextual prompts for my AI coding assistant, so that I can begin implementation with proper context without manual research.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click on a task with status "not_started" AND isExecutable=true THEN the system SHALL extract task context and generate a Cursor-compatible prompt
2. WHEN a prompt is generated THEN it SHALL include task description, dependencies, requirements mapping, and relevant architectural context
3. WHEN the prompt is ready THEN the system SHALL trigger Cursor's chat interface with the generated prompt
4. IF a task is already "in_progress" or "completed" THEN the click SHALL expand task details instead of generating a prompt
