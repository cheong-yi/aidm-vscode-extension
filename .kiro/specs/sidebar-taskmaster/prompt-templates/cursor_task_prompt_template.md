**Context Selection Rule**: Include maximum 3-4 files to avoid context window overload

## Context

You are implementing a VSCode extension component for the Sidebar Taskmaster Dashboard. This task implements [specific functionality] matching the expandable list mockup design.

**Project State**: [Brief description of what's already implemented and working]

**Integration Requirements**: This task must integrate with [specific existing components/services]

## Mockup Reference

Reference taskmaster_mockup.html lines [X-Y]:

- Specific CSS classes: [.task-item, .task-header, etc.]
- HTML structure: [div containers, button elements, etc.]
- Visual behavior: [expansion, styling, interactions]
- Interactive elements: [buttons, dropdowns, collapsible sections]

## Task Description

- **ID**: [Task ID]
- **Title**: [Task Title]
- **Complexity**: [Low/Medium/High]
- **Dependencies**: [Completed task IDs]
- **Duration**: 15-30 minutes
- **Requirements Mapping**: [Specific requirement numbers this addresses]

## Enhanced Data Requirements

Must implement with enhanced Task interface:

```typescript
// Provide exact interface snippet relevant to this task
interface TaskEnhanced {
  // ... specific fields needed for this task
  estimatedDuration?: string; // "15-30 min"
  isExecutable?: boolean; // For Cursor integration
  testStatus?: TestStatus; // Enhanced with FailingTest[]
  statusDisplayName?: string; // From STATUS_DISPLAY_NAMES mapping
}
```
````

## Expected Input/Output Examples

```typescript
// Input example:
const inputTask = {
  id: "3.1.2",
  title: "Add TaskTreeItem status indicator property",
  status: "not_started",
  isExecutable: true,
  estimatedDuration: "15-20 min",
};

// Expected output:
const expectedResult = {
  // ... specific expected results with actual values
};

// Error scenarios:
const errorCase = {
  // ... specific error conditions and expected handling
};
```

## Implementation Details

### Primary Implementation Steps

1. [Specific implementation step with method/class names]
2. [Another specific step with exact code patterns]
3. [Integration step with existing services]

### Code Patterns to Follow

- [ ] [Another requirement with validation method]
- [ ] UI matches mockup exactly (reference specific mockup elements)
- [ ] Enhanced data structure compliance verified
- [ ] Error handling covers [specific error scenarios]
- [ ] Performance meets [specific benchmarks if applicable]

## Testing Requirements

Write focused unit tests for:

- [ ] [Specific test case 1 with expected assertions]
- [ ] [Specific test case 2 with mock data]
- [ ] Error scenarios: [specific error conditions and expected responses]
- [ ] Mockup compliance: [UI validation tests with specific checks]
- [ ] Integration: [Tests for service communication]

### Test Data Requirements

- Include edge cases: [specific edge cases relevant to this task]
- Test with enhanced data fields populated

## Validation Checklist

Before completing, verify:

- [ ] Visual output matches mockup HTML/CSS exactly
- [ ] Enhanced data fields are properly implemented and tested
- [ ] TimeFormattingUtility used for all timestamps (if applicable)
- [ ] Executable task indicators work correctly (blue border + ðŸ¤–)
- [ ] Status actions map correctly to task state
- [ ] Error categorization follows project patterns
- [ ] Event emission works for UI synchronization
- [ ] Resource cleanup implemented (if applicable)

## Files to Modify

- `[exact file path]` - [what changes to make with specific method names]
- `[test file path]` - [what tests to add with test names]
- `[config file]` - [configuration changes needed]

## Integration Verification

After implementation, test these integration points:

- [ ] [Component A] â†’ [Component B] communication
- [ ] Event flow: [specific event chain]
- [ ] Data consistency: [specific data synchronization]

## Performance Considerations

## Usage Instructions

### Before Starting Implementation
1. Copy this template for each atomic task
2. Add all Context Files listed above to your AI conversation
3. Fill in all bracketed placeholders with specific information from your project files
4. Reference exact mockup elements and line numbers from taskmaster_mockup.html
5. Cross-reference requirements.md for acceptance criteria
6. Check tasks.md for dependencies and related work

### During Implementation
1. Provide concrete data examples, not abstract interfaces
2. Include specific validation steps with measurable outcomes
3. Always reference the enhanced data structures from design.md
4. Follow existing code patterns from context files
