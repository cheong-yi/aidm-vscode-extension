# Implementation Plan - Sidebar Taskmaster Dashboard (Atomic Tasks)

## Overview

This implementation plan breaks down the feature into atomic, TDD-friendly tasks that match the expandable list mockup design. Each task should take 15-30 minutes and implement one focused piece of functionality with its tests. The plan emphasizes enhanced data structures, time formatting, test failure details, and executable task indicators.

## Current Implementation Status

**Progress: ~65% Complete**

### Critical Blockers Identified ❌

**CRITICAL BLOCKER 1: Missing UI Registration** (Severity: HIGH)

- Issue: Taskmaster components are implemented but NOT registered in extension.ts
- Impact: Extension will compile but Taskmaster UI will never appear
- Evidence: No registerTreeDataProvider or registerWebviewViewProvider calls found

**CRITICAL BLOCKER 2: Missing Task Mock Data** (Severity: HIGH)

- Issue: MockDataProvider has no task generation methods
- Impact: TasksDataService will fail to provide data, causing UI to show empty state
- Evidence: MockDataProvider only generates business requirements, not tasks

**CRITICAL BLOCKER 3: Missing Package.json Configuration** (Severity: HIGH)

- Issue: VSCode contribution points not defined for Taskmaster views and commands
- Impact: VSCode will not recognize Taskmaster UI components
- Evidence: No viewsContainers or command contributions for taskmaster

## Enhanced Development Guidelines

### Enhanced Atomic Task Principles

- Each task should take 15-30 minutes maximum
- Implement one method, class, or focused functionality per task with enhanced data
- Write focused unit tests for each task including enhanced data structures
- Clear dependencies between tasks marked explicitly
- No task should implement multiple disparate features
- Always include enhanced data fields in implementations

### Enhanced TDD Workflow Per Task

1. Write failing test(s) for the specific functionality with enhanced data
2. Implement minimum code to make tests pass including enhanced fields
3. Refactor and clean up code ensuring enhanced data integrity
4. Verify integration with previous tasks and enhanced data flow
5. Move to next task only when current is complete with enhanced validation

### Enhanced Integration Strategy

- Test enhanced integration points as separate tasks
- Build enhanced functionality incrementally
- Maintain working state after each enhanced task
- No orphaned or hanging code at any stage
- Always validate enhanced data structures

### Enhanced VSCode Extension Considerations

- Always test enhanced extension activation/deactivation
- Implement proper enhanced resource disposal
- Handle enhanced VSCode context switching gracefully
- Consider enhanced extension startup time impact
- Test with multiple enhanced workspace scenarios

### Enhanced Cursor Integration Considerations

- Always implement enhanced fallback mechanisms (clipboard copy)
- Test with both enhanced Cursor available and unavailable scenarios
- Validate enhanced extracted context before prompt generation
- Handle different enhanced Cursor installation patterns
- Provide clear enhanced user feedback for AI operations

### Critical Success Factors

1. **Mockup Alignment**: Every UI task must reference specific mockup elements
2. **Data Contract Compliance**: All data structures must match the enhanced Task interface
3. **Time Formatting Consistency**: All timestamps must use the TimeFormattingUtility
4. **Executable Task Logic**: Clear rules for when tasks show the robot icon and blue border
5. **Test Result Integration**: Proper handling of FailingTest objects with error categorization
6. **Status Action Mapping**: Correct implementation of STATUS_ACTIONS for different task states

These enhanced specifications provide a comprehensive foundation for implementing the expandable list Taskmaster Dashboard that precisely matches your mockup design.
