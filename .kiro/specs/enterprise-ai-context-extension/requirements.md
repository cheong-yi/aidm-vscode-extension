# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Enterprise AI Context VSCode Extension is an innovative solution that bridges the gap between business requirements and code implementation in enterprise environments. The system provides contextual business information to human developers through hover functionality and enables AI assistants to access rich project context via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This addresses the critical enterprise pain point where developers lack context about why code was written, what business requirements it fulfills, and how changes might impact other system components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to hover over code elements and see relevant business context, so that I can understand the business purpose and requirements behind the implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer hovers over a code element in TypeScript files (additional language support in future phases) THEN the system SHALL display a hover popup containing relevant business context within 200ms
2. WHEN business context is available for a code element THEN the system SHALL show requirements, implementation status, and related changes
3. WHEN no business context is available THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating no context found
4. WHEN the hover popup is displayed THEN it SHALL include formatted business requirements, implementation notes, and related change history
5. IF the system encounters an error retrieving context THEN it SHALL display an appropriate error message without breaking the hover functionality

### Requirement 2 (Future Enhancement - Deprioritized)

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to search for business requirements across the project using keywords or phrases, so that I can find which code implements specific business functionality and understand system dependencies.

**Priority:** Nice to have - Future backlog item

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer opens the requirements search panel (via command palette or shortcut) THEN the system SHALL provide a search interface within VSCode
2. WHEN search terms are entered (e.g., "user authentication", "payment processing") THEN the system SHALL return matching requirements with relevance scoring
3. WHEN search results are displayed THEN each result SHALL show requirement title, description, and related code file locations with line numbers
4. WHEN a search result is selected THEN the system SHALL navigate to the relevant code file and highlight the implementing functions/classes
5. IF no results are found THEN the system SHALL display a "no results found" message with search suggestions and similar requirements

**Note:** This requirement is deprioritized for the initial MVP. Focus should be on core hover functionality and MCP integration first.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see the connection status between the VSCode extension and the MCP server, so that I can understand if the context system is functioning properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is active THEN the system SHALL display a status indicator in the VSCode status bar
2. WHEN the MCP server is connected and healthy THEN the status indicator SHALL show a green connected state
3. WHEN the MCP server is disconnected or unhealthy THEN the status indicator SHALL show a red disconnected state
4. WHEN the status indicator is clicked THEN the system SHALL display basic connection status (detailed metrics in Phase 2)
5. WHEN connection issues occur THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic reconnection and log appropriate error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an AI assistant, I want to access rich project context through MCP protocol, so that I can provide better code suggestions and understand business requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an AI assistant connects via MCP THEN the system SHALL expose available tools and capabilities
2. WHEN an AI assistant requests project context THEN the system SHALL return structured business requirements and code relationships
3. WHEN an AI assistant queries for specific requirements THEN the system SHALL return relevant business context with proper formatting
4. WHEN multiple AI assistants connect simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent requests without performance degradation
5. IF an AI assistant request fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses following MCP protocol standards

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the extension to handle errors gracefully and provide audit capabilities, so that I can ensure system reliability and compliance in enterprise environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any system error occurs THEN the extension SHALL log detailed error information without exposing sensitive data
2. WHEN external dependencies are unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to cached data or mock responses
3. WHEN user interactions occur THEN the system SHALL maintain an audit trail of access patterns and data requests
4. WHEN the system starts up THEN it SHALL validate all configuration and dependencies before becoming available
5. IF critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL continue operating in degraded mode rather than completely failing

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to work with mock data initially, so that I can evaluate the functionality without requiring complex enterprise integrations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is in mock mode THEN it SHALL provide realistic business context data for demonstration purposes
2. WHEN mock data is displayed THEN it SHALL represent typical enterprise scenarios including requirements, changes, and relationships
3. WHEN switching between mock and real data modes THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent user experience and API contracts
4. WHEN mock data is used THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the data source to prevent confusion
5. IF mock data generation fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback static data to ensure functionality demonstration

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a development team, I want comprehensive test coverage and TypeScript type safety, so that we can maintain code quality and reliability as the system evolves.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is written THEN it SHALL include comprehensive unit tests achieving >80% coverage
2. WHEN components interact THEN integration tests SHALL verify proper data flow and error handling
3. WHEN TypeScript compilation occurs THEN it SHALL complete without errors or warnings
4. WHEN external dependencies are mocked THEN tests SHALL verify proper abstraction layer functionality
5. IF test failures occur THEN the build process SHALL prevent deployment until issues are resolved

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an AI assistant (specifically RooCode), I want to access both local sprint context and future enterprise delivery patterns through a unified MCP interface, so that I can provide context-aware code suggestions that align with both current project needs and proven delivery methodologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN RooCode queries for current context THEN it SHALL receive sprint details, story context, and team coding patterns from local MCP
2. WHEN RooCode queries for delivery intelligence THEN the system SHALL be architected to support future remote MCP integration for institutional knowledge
3. WHEN RooCode generates code suggestions THEN they SHALL incorporate available business context and delivery patterns
4. WHEN multiple AI queries occur simultaneously THEN the hybrid architecture SHALL handle both local and future remote requests efficiently
5. IF remote delivery intelligence is unavailable THEN RooCode SHALL still receive rich local context for immediate development needs

### Requirement 9 (New) – Pluggable Context Sources and Priority

**User Story:** As a developer and AI assistant, I want the local MCP to aggregate context from multiple sources in a defined priority so that the most accurate and deterministic context is used first.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a context request arrives THEN the system SHALL query sources in the configured order (default: mockCache → remote → generated)
2. WHEN a higher-priority source returns a result THEN the system SHALL NOT query lower-priority sources
3. WHEN no source returns a result THEN the system SHALL return a well-formed empty context
4. WHEN configuration changes THEN the new priority SHALL take effect without code changes
5. WHEN provenance is available THEN the hover SHALL indicate the source in the UI in a non-intrusive way

### Requirement 10 (New) – Background Seeding and Sync

**User Story:** As a system maintainer, I want the local MCP to be able to seed and periodically sync the local cache from a remote MCP so that developers get fast, offline-friendly context while reducing load on remote APIs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `seed_from_remote` is invoked with target paths THEN the system SHALL fetch and persist context to `.aidm/mock-cache.json`
2. WHEN daily sync is configured THEN the system SHALL refresh cached entries without blocking hover requests
3. WHEN remote is unavailable THEN the system SHALL skip sync and retain existing cache
4. WHEN sensitive fields are detected in seeded data THEN basic PII redaction SHALL be applied per local policy (e.g., Singapore PDPA)
5. WHEN OAuth credentials expire THEN the system SHALL surface an actionable error and avoid partial writes
