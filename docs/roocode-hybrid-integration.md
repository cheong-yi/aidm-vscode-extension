# RooCode Hybrid MCP Integration

This document describes how RooCode integrates with the hybrid MCP architecture to provide context-aware code suggestions using both local sprint context and remote delivery intelligence.

## Architecture Overview

The hybrid MCP architecture enables RooCode to access two types of context:

1. **Local Context** - Immediate sprint and project information
2. **Remote Intelligence** - Institutional knowledge and proven delivery patterns

    ],
    commonPitfalls: [
      "Don't store raw payment data",
      "Avoid client-side payment validation only"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Response Times

- **Local Context**: < 200ms (cached sprint data)
- **Remote Intelligence**: < 2s (delivery patterns)
- **Hybrid Queries**: < 800ms (concurrent execution)
- **Concurrent Handling**: 3+ simultaneous AI assistants

### Optimization Strategies

- **Concurrent Execution**: Local and remote queries run in parallel
- **Intelligent Caching**: Frequently accessed patterns cached locally
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback to cached/mock data when services unavailable
- **Request Batching**: Multiple related queries combined for efficiency

## Fallback Behavior

### Local Server Unavailable

- Use cached sprint data from previous sessions
- Provide mock sprint context for demonstration
- Maintain basic team pattern guidance

### Remote Server Unavailable

- Use cached delivery patterns
- Provide general best practices
- Fall back to technology-specific guidance

### Both Servers Unavailable

- Offline mode with static guidance
- Basic code suggestions without context
- Clear indication of limited functionality

**Example Fallback Response:**

```typescript
{
  suggestion: "Working in offline mode with limited context...",
  localContext: {
    sprintAlignment: "Offline mode - no sprint context available",
    storyRelevance: "Offline mode - no story context available",
    teamPatterns: ["General TypeScript patterns"]
  },
  remoteIntelligence: {
    deliveryPatterns: ["Standard offline patterns"],
    institutionalGuidance: ["Follow TypeScript best practices"],
    crossProjectLearnings: ["Offline mode - limited insights"]
  },
  hybridInsights: ["Working in offline mode with limited context"],
  confidence: 0.3,
  sources: ["Offline fallback data"]
}
```

## Integration Examples

### Example 1: Payment Service Implementation

**RooCode Query:**

```typescript
{
  type: "code_suggestion",
  filePath: "src/services/PaymentService.ts",
  codeSnippet: `
    export class PaymentService {
      async processPayment(amount: number, method: string): Promise<PaymentResult> {
        // Need implementation
      }
    }
  `,
  technology: "typescript",
  userIntent: "Implement secure payment processing with fraud detection"
}
```

**Hybrid Response:**

```typescript
{
  suggestion: `
    Based on your current story "Implement secure payment processing" and proven
    delivery pattern "Secure Payment Processing Pattern", here's my suggestion:

    export class PaymentService {
      async processPayment(amount: number, method: string): Promise<PaymentResult> {
        // Validate input (sprint requirement: fraud detection)
        this.validatePaymentData(amount, method);

        // Apply proven pattern: tokenization
        const token = await this.tokenizePaymentData(method);

        // Process with fraud detection (story requirement)
        const fraudCheck = await this.fraudDetectionService.analyze(amount, token);
        if (!fraudCheck.isValid) {
          throw new PaymentError('Fraud detected', fraudCheck.reason);
        }

        // Process payment following enterprise pattern
        return await this.paymentGateway.process({
          amount,
          token,
          fraudScore: fraudCheck.score
        });
      }

    deliveryPatterns: ["Secure Payment Processing Pattern (92% success rate)"],
    institutionalGuidance: [
      "Always validate payment data server-side",
      "Use tokenization for sensitive payment data"
    ],
    crossProjectLearnings: [
      "Teams using fraud detection patterns see 40% fewer payment issues"
    ]
  },
  hybridInsights: [
    "Current sprint 'Payment Integration Sprint' can benefit from 1 proven delivery pattern",
    "Story 'Implement secure payment processing' aligns with 2 institutional best practices"
  ],
  confidence: 0.89,
  sources: ["Local Sprint Context", "Remote Delivery Intelligence", "Team Patterns"]
}
```

### Example 2: Context Analysis for User Model

**RooCode Query:**

```typescript
{
  type: "context_analysis",
  filePath: "src/models/User.ts",
  codeSnippet: `
    interface User {
      id: string;
      email: string;
      profile: UserProfile;
      paymentMethods: PaymentMethod[];
    }
  `,
  technology: "typescript",
  userIntent: "Understand business context and relationships"
}
```

**Hybrid Response:**

```typescript
{
  suggestion: `
    Context Analysis for src/models/User.ts:

    **Sprint Context:**
    - Current Story: Implement secure payment processing

    - Implement user profile caching for performance
  `,
  localContext: {
    sprintAlignment: "User model supports current payment integration sprint",
    storyRelevance: "PaymentMethod relationship directly supports PAY-123 story",
    teamPatterns: ["Interface Design Standards", "Data Validation Patterns"]
  },
  remoteIntelligence: {
    deliveryPatterns: [
      "User Management Pattern (87% success rate)",
      "Payment Integration Pattern (92% success rate)"
    ],
    institutionalGuidance: [
      "Always encrypt sensitive user data",
      "Implement proper user validation",
      "Consider GDPR compliance for user data"
    ],
    crossProjectLearnings: [

    "Team validation patterns support institutional security guidance"
  ],
  confidence: 0.82,
  sources: ["Local Sprint Context", "Remote Delivery Intelligence", "Business Requirements"]
}
```

## Concurrent Request Handling

The hybrid architecture supports multiple simultaneous AI assistant requests:

### Concurrent Execution Pattern

```typescript
// Multiple RooCode instances can query simultaneously
const queries = [
  { type: "code_suggestion", filePath: "src/auth/AuthService.ts", ... },
  { type: "context_analysis", filePath: "src/models/Order.ts", ... },
  { type: "delivery_guidance", filePath: "src/api/PaymentAPI.ts", ... }
];

// All queries execute concurrently
const responses = await Promise.all(
  queries.map(query => hybridClient.processRooCodeQuery(query))
);
```

### Performance Optimization

- **Connection Pooling**: Reuse HTTP connections for multiple requests
- **Request Batching**: Combine related queries when possible
- **Intelligent Caching**: Cache frequently accessed patterns
- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevent cascade failures during high load

### Load Balancing

- **Local Server**: Handles immediate sprint context (fast response)
- **Remote Server**: Handles delivery intelligence (higher latency acceptable)
- **Hybrid Coordination**: Balances load between local and remote sources

## Testing and Validation

### Integration Tests

- **Connectivity Testing**: Verify local and remote server connections
- **Query Processing**: Test all query types with various inputs
- **Concurrent Handling**: Validate multiple simultaneous requests
