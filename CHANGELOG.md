- Demo scenarios for multiple industry verticals
- Configurable UI themes and performance settings
- Comprehensive test suite with >80% coverage target
- Security features including data sanitization
- Graceful degradation and fallback mechanisms

### Features

- **Hover Context**: Business requirements and implementation status on hover
- **AI Integration**: Rich project context via MCP protocol
- **Status Monitoring**: Real-time server connection status
- **Mock Data**: Realistic enterprise scenarios for demonstration

- **Performance Optimization**: Caching, concurrent request handling
- **Enterprise Security**: Audit trails, error boundaries, data protection

### Configuration Options

- MCP server settings (port, timeout, retry attempts)
- Mock data configuration (size, patterns, industry vertical)
- Demo scenario settings (complexity, compliance data)
- UI customization (themes, popup behavior)
- Performance tuning (concurrent requests, caching)

### Technical Implementation

- TypeScript-first development with strict type checking
- Jest testing framework with comprehensive coverage
- ESLint code quality enforcement
- HTTP JSON-RPC communication protocol
- Memory-based caching with TTL expiration
- Process lifecycle management
- Error recovery and retry mechanisms

### Demo Capabilities

- Financial services: Banking, payments, fraud detection
- Healthcare: Patient data, compliance, regulatory
- Retail: E-commerce, inventory, customer management
